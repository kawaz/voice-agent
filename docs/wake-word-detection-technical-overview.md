# Wake Word Detection Technical Overview

## Introduction

Wake word detection, also known as keyword spotting, is a critical component in voice-activated systems that enables hands-free interaction with devices. This technology continuously monitors audio input to detect specific trigger phrases (e.g., "Hey Siri", "Alexa", "OK Google") that activate the main speech recognition system. This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of wake word detection mechanisms, algorithms, approaches, and requirements.

## How Wake Word Detection Works

### Core Components

Wake word detection systems consist of several key components working together:

1. **Audio Capture**: Continuous recording of audio input through microphones
2. **Feature Extraction**: Conversion of raw audio into meaningful representations
3. **Acoustic Modeling**: Neural networks that process features to detect wake words
4. **Decision Making**: Threshold-based classification to determine wake word presence

### Processing Pipeline

The typical wake word detection pipeline follows these steps:

1. **Audio Preprocessing**
   - Raw audio is captured at 16-44.1kHz sampling rate
   - Audio is segmented into frames (typically 25-30ms with 10ms overlap)
   - Noise reduction and enhancement may be applied

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are commonly used
   - Melspectrograms convert audio into 2D time-frequency representations
   - Features capture spectral characteristics relevant for speech

3. **Neural Network Processing**
   - Features are fed to trained neural networks
   - Networks output probability scores for wake word presence
   - Continuous scoring happens on sliding windows of audio

4. **Threshold-based Detection**
   - Output probabilities are compared against predetermined thresholds
   - Detection triggers when probability exceeds threshold
   - Post-processing may verify detection to reduce false positives

## Common Approaches
