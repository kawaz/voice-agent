# Power-Efficient Wake Word Detection: Comprehensive Recommendations

## Executive Summary

Achieving ultra-low power wake word detection requires a multi-faceted approach combining specialized hardware, optimized software architectures, and advanced model compression techniques. Based on current research and industry implementations, power consumption targets of sub-milliwatt operation (140-390 µW) are achievable while maintaining robust detection accuracy.

## Hardware Acceleration Options

### 1. Specialized Wake Word Chips

  - NDP120: 25x computation improvement over NDP101
  - Certified for Amazon Alexa wake word detection
  - 200x more efficient than traditional solutions

#### Ambiq Apollo Series with DSP
- **Power Consumption**: ~390 µW for 11 Chinese voice commands
- **Key Features**:
  - Apollo3 Blue: 3 µA/MHz with SPOT technology
  - Voice-on-SPOT (VoS) enables year-long battery life

### 2. Microcontroller Comparisons

| Platform | Sleep Current | Active Power | Wake Word Support |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Nordic nRF | 2.6 µA | 15 mA @ +8dBm | Low power, no dedicated support |
| STM32 | ~20 µA | Variable | ARM Cortex-M efficiency |
| ESP32 | 5 µA | 250 mA peaks | WakeNet support built-in |

**Recommendation**: For dedicated wake word applications, use Syntiant or Ambiq specialized chips. For general-purpose applications, Nordic nRF offers the best power efficiency.

## Software Optimization Techniques

### 1. Cascaded Two-Stage Architecture

Implement a two-stage system for optimal power/accuracy trade-off:

**First Stage (On-Device)**:
- Lightweight model for initial detection
- Process 40 spectrogram features every 10 ms
- Streaming inference every 30 ms
- Quantized to INT8 for efficiency

**Second Stage (Server/Higher-Power)**:
- Ensemble of heterogeneous architectures
- Custom verifier models for specific voices
- 16% reduction in false rejection rates
- 37% reduction in false alarms

### 2. Model Quantization

#### Recommended Quantization Levels:
- **INT8**: 75% memory/bandwidth reduction, negligible accuracy loss
- **INT4**: Further compression with minimal degradation
- **Binary**: Extreme compression using sparse binarization
  - 4x faster than previous state-of-the-art
  - Better noise robustness
  - Suitable for ultra-low power edge devices

### 3. Model Pruning Strategies

#### Structured Pruning (Recommended):
- Remove entire filters maintaining regular structure
- 61.1% FLOPs reduction with no accuracy loss (ResNet-56)
- Compatible with quantization for deeper compression

#### Sparse Binarization:
- Dynamic feature selection
- Discards non-informative features
- 4x speedup with improved accuracy
- More robust in noisy environments

## Power Consumption Targets and Benchmarks

### Target Power Budgets by Device Type:

#### Smartphones

## Battery Life Considerations

### Key Strategies:

1. **Wake-on-Sound (WoS)**
   - Device in WoS mode 60% of time in quiet environments
   - Significant power savings vs. continuous processing

2. **Analog Domain Processing**
   - Process sounds before digitization
   - 10x lower power than digital processing

3. **Selective Wake-up**
   - 540 ms latency acceptable for 100,000x power improvement
   - Only power up when wake word detected

## Best Practices by Device Type

### Smartphones
1. Leverage existing DSP/NPU capabilities
2. Implement cascaded detection with cloud verification
3. Use INT8 quantization minimum
4. Target <1% battery impact daily
